        <p>
            Since 2015, I've been a programming languages researcher working on
            <a href="https://syndicate-lang.org">Syndicate</a>, an actor-based
            language oriented around publish/subscribe communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in the role that <em>protocols</em> play in program
            design and implementation. For many programs, and especially those
            requiring concurrency, the protocols of communication between
            components are as important as the components themselves. Yet, most
            programming languages provide little if any support for the design,
            implementation, and verification of these protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            My work on Syndicate has pursued using a type system as the avenue
            for introducing explicit support for protocols to the language. To
            achieve this, I first designed a type system for Syndicate that
            captures the essence of its form of publish/subscribe communication.

            I then extended this basic design with a type-and-effect system that
            captures the communication behaviors of the actors in a program.
            This communication specification is then compiled into the input
            language of a model checker, which verifies the program with respect
            to specifications of its protocols.
